# Hand Gesture Recognition System

## Description
This project implements a **real-time hand gesture recognition system** using Python, OpenCV, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It captures live video from a webcam, detects hand regions, and classifies gestures into predefined categories such as numbers, alphabets, or control commands.

This system can be used for applications like **sign language translation**, **touchless user interfaces**, and **human-computer interaction**.

---

## Features
- Real-time video capture and processing.
- Hand detection and preprocessing (resizing, normalization).
- CNN-based model for accurate gesture classification.
- Easy to extend with new gesture classes.
- Supports integration with other software/hardware.

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy

---

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
https://github.com/AIhub15/hand-gesture-recognition.git


2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the main script:
python main.py


---

## Usage
- Launch the script to open the webcam.
- Perform hand gestures in front of the camera.
- The system will recognize and display the detected gesture in real-time.

---

## Dataset
- The project uses a custom dataset of hand gesture images.
- You can also train the CNN model on your own dataset by following the training script provided.

---

## Future Improvements
- Support dynamic gestures (gesture sequences).
- Add support for more complex gestures.
- Integrate with hardware devices (e.g., robotic arms).
